/**
  * Vector is a general-purpose, immutable data structure.
  * It provides random access and updates in effectively constant time, as well as very fast append and prepend.
  * Because vectors strike a good balance between fast random selections and fast random functional updates, they are currently the default implementation of immutable indexed sequences.
  * It is backed by a little endian bit-mapped vector trie with a branching factor of 32.
  * Locality is very good, but not contiguous, which is good for very large sequences.
